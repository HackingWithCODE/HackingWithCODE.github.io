The mission of CO/DE is to strengthen Columbus Ohio's cybersecurity community through technical knowledge sharing and collaboration. Our aim is to provide free and inclusive cybersecurity training through hands-on workshops.

If you've been to any of the cybersecurity events here in Columbus you've witnessed amazing talent first hand; from [614con](http://614con.org/) to [Columbus' OWASP chapter](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Columbus) and The Ohio State University's [Cybersecurity Club](https://osucyber.club/). These groups exemplify the passion and dedication of the local community.

Through CO/DE workshops you'll gain real-world experience from cybersecurity professionals and mentors in a variety of cybersecurity disciplines.
