CO/DE's mission is to develop deep, technical, open source cybersecurity training material. Our aim is to provide free and inclusive cybersecurity training through hands-on workshops you can teach within your organization, club, university, or just go through solo. 

Through CO/DE workshops you'll gain real-world experience with hand-ons lessons built by cybersecurity professionals specializing in a variety of disciplines. 

We've learned nearly everything we know from free online content and our peers. We marveled at Aleph1's Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit, reverse engineered our way through Lena151 tutorials using Ollydbg, we worked tirelessly through Corelan's win32 exploitation guides, and spent countless sleepless weekends competing in CTFs. All of this amazing content (and much more) provided for free, without anything asked in return.

CO/DE's one and only goal is to continue this tradition within the cybersecurity community and give back to the community.
