## Overview

Reverse engineering is an important skillset for many cybersecurity disciplines. Whether you're interested in vulnerability discovery, software testing, advanced debugging, or IP protection, reverse engineering knowledge is an imporant skill to add to your repertoire.

## Workshop Outline

This workshop is a survey of reverse engineering (RE) skills designed to expose students to the applications of RE and how deeper exploration in a specific application may benefit you and your organization.

In this workshop you will:

- Reverse engineer x86, Java, and .NET applications.
- Explore common tools and methods for understanding applications at their most fundamental level.
- Learn how to analyze, debug, and patch a the applications we reverse engineer.
- Gain insight into the compiler process that transforms high-level code into machine and bytecode.

## Requirements

CO/DE workshops are designed to allow participants to learn by doing. If you signup for this workshop, please come with a laptop and ready to learn.

- A laptop with Docker installed.
- Willingness to learn by firehose.
- A pre-workshop setup guide will be sent to participants, please have this completed before the workshop.

## Workshop Instructors

Your instructors will guide you through the workshop experience by introducing the material, providing practical uses for the subject you'll be using and answer your questions. Their goal is to teach you something new and keep you engaged through the workshop.
