## Workshop Status
Planning phase. When development begins, you can track our progress on [Github](https://github.com/HackingWithCODE).

## Overview

Static analysis of binary code can be a complex process, but thankfully there are advanced methods and tools to assist us in this process. Whether you're analyzing malware, finding vulnerabilities, writing exploits, or just playing CTFs, [Angr](http://angr.io/) offers powerful analysis options to aid your workflow and save you time.

## Workshop Outline

The goal of this workshop is to teach students how to perform symbolic execution on binary targets for a variety of purposes. We acomplish this using Angr, one of many binary analysis tools available.

In this workshop you will:

- Learn what symbolic and concolic analysis are in plain English.
- Learn several ways symbolic and concolic analysis can help you perform binary analysis.
- Learn how to configure and use [Angr](http://angr.io/), a power binary analysis framework.
- Apply Angr to a variety of challenges that illustrate its power and usefulness.
- Get a chance to learn alongside your peers in an immersive environment.
