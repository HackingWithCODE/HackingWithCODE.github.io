## Overview

[IDA Pro](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/) and [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/) dominate today's reverse engineering toolset and for good reason. They are powerful, intuitive, and offer rich plugin interfaces and APIs for customization and automation. But these tools come at a financial cost that some security teams may find hard to justify. By exploring the free [Radare2](https://rada.re/r/) reverse engineering platform, we'll help you get over the learning curve of this incredibly  powerful but complex suite of reverse engineering tools. 

## Workshop Outline

Radare2 is a free and open-source reverse engineering framework. Consisting of numerous tools, Radare2 offers everything you need to perform binary analysis but it's arguably one of the most complex and difficult to learn tools available, restricting its adoption.

In this workshop you will:

- How to install and update Radare2.
- Learn the various components of Radare2 and how you can put them to use in real-world situations.
- Navigate the complex command-line interface and switch between views easily and effortlessly.
- Debug binary applications.
- Gain exposure to Radare2's Evaluable Strings Intermediate Language (ESIL).
- Experience a workflow that allows you to navigate, debug, comment, save and load analysis.
- Automate Radare2 analysis via r2pipe and Python.

## Requirements

Students will find this workshop extremely difficult without prior exposure to x86 and reverse engineering concepts. If you are new to binary reverse engineering we highly suggest signing up for our Binary Reverse Engineering workshop first, or at a minimum come to work along with a friend who has RE experience. 

- A laptop with DOcker installed.
- Willingness to learn by firehose
- Some exposure to RE and RE tools like IDA Pro, Binary Ninja, ollydbg, etc.

## Workshop Instructors

Your instructors will guide you through the workshop experience by introducing the material, and challenging you with hands-on exercises. Their goal is to teach you something new and keep you engaged through the workshop.

## Workshop Mentors

Your mentors are cybersecurity experts that have demonstrated experience in the subject matter being taught during the workshop. They will walk around the room and help individuals with questions or troubleshoot problems while the instructor keeps the workshop moving along.
