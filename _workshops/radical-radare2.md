## Workshop Status
This workshop is currently in development. Checkout the status on [Github](https://github.com/HackingWithCODE/radical-radare2).

## Overview

[IDA Pro](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/) and [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/) dominate today's reverse engineering toolset and for good reason. They are powerful, intuitive, and offer rich plugin interfaces and APIs for customization and automation. But these tools come at a financial cost that some security teams may find hard to justify. By exploring the free [Radare2](https://rada.re/r/) reverse engineering platform, we'll help you get over the learning curve of this incredibly  powerful but complex suite of reverse engineering tools. 

## Workshop Outline

Radare2 is a free and open-source reverse engineering framework. Consisting of numerous tools, Radare2 offers everything you need to perform binary analysis but it's arguably one of the most complex and difficult to learn tools available, restricting its adoption.

In this workshop you will:

- How to install and update Radare2.
- Learn the various components of Radare2 and how you can put them to use in real-world situations.
- Navigate the complex command-line interface and switch between views easily and effortlessly.
- Debug binary applications.
- Gain exposure to Radare2's Evaluable Strings Intermediate Language (ESIL).
- Experience a workflow that allows you to navigate, debug, comment, save and load analysis.
- Automate Radare2 analysis via r2pipe and Python.
