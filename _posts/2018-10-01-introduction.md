CO/DE is the realization of a vision many years in the making. Like you, we've worked tirelessly in persuit of excelllence in our specializations, mentoring others and learning from our peers. Over the years we've created and taught deep technical cybersecurity content to exclusive groups within our organizations and universities. While this experience was rewarding, the audience is far too limited. The enclusive nature of only sharing this material with coworkers and those fortunate enough to attend college seems like a disservice to the cybersecurity community.

It seems strange to keep this knowledge locked within an exclusive group of people, when we ourselves learned nearly everything we know through the generocity of others. We marveled at Aleph1's Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit, reverse engineered our way through Lena151 tutorials using Ollydbg, we worked tirelessly through Corelan's win32 exploitation guides, and spent countless sleepless weekends competing in CTFs. All of this amazing content (and much more) provided for free, without anything asked in return.

In the true spirit of the cybersecurity community, CO/DE is developing open source technical cybersecurity workshops for everyone. It doesn't matter if you're working for a Fortune 100 company, the lone security professional in a small business, or trying to break into the industry, CO/DE's material is free to use.
