If you know a teacher, please hug them because they probably need it. With so many learning styles, individual quirks, learning disabilities, and experience levels, it’s nearly impossible to reach everyone in a class full of unique individuals.

Part of the immense challenge of teaching also includes the various theories, formats, and styles a teacher can use to reach individuals. Like students, each teacher has a preferred method of teaching material and enforcing it. Some methods of teaching are passive, while others are hands-on. If you think of a typical college course, some professors will teach an entire semester without ever requiring student involvement (or attendance) while others consider participation a part of your grade.

There appears to be a bit of a holy war online about the semantics around Trainings vs. Workshops. Here at CO/DE we use the term “workshop” to communicate the type of content we’re developing which may be confusing to some people (yay semantics).

To try and clear up the semantics behind the various formats of teaching technical content, I’ll break them down according to how I interpret them.

## Articles & Blogs

By far the most common method of communicating useful technical content is through articles and blog posts. Just visit [/r/netsec](https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/) or [/r/SecurityEngineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/securityengineering/) and you'll encounter hundreds of amazing articles, each unique in form and style.

Articles and blogs can involve a fair amount of personal bias, even verging into op-ed territory. While they can be deeply technical, there’s usually a fair about of anecdotal material between the facts.

## Peer Reviewed Journal Articles

A few steps above common articles and blogs are peer-reviewed journal articles. These include articles found in Phrack and `PoC||GTFO`. These are deeply technical and have little room for personal opinion and commentary. They aim to express the facts and outcomes of a specific research initiative.

## Tutorials

Tutorials aim to demonstrate by example. Typical tutorials start from basic concepts and build into more complex material, but maintain the same format throughout.

Students are free to follow the examples in the tutorial on their own time but have little to no means of asking questions if they get stuck or get different results from those shown in the tutorial.

By nature tutorials are very mechanical and deliberate, offering little to no room for creative exploration.

## Lectures

The lecture format can change greatly depending on the lecturer. Some lecturers teach from slides without encouraging class participation, while others lecturers show examples, use the board, call on students, conduct thought experiments, etc.

The lecture format rarely allows time for collaboration between students. The entire lecture is usually a monologue of the lecturer with short moments of dialog, often just to illustrate a point the lecturer is trying to make.

## Technical Workshops

Workshops are small to medium collaborative learning sessions where students and instructors explore technical material. Workshops encourage participation and give students a chance to collaborate and work on hands-on tasks to enforce what they are learning.

Workshops often have an instructor-lead segment where information is introduced in the form of a lecture. Demonstrations are given, students work on problems, and the group comes back together to discuss their solutions, issues, and comments. In a workshop, the instructor typically wears many hats including lecturer, moderator, cheerleader, devil’s advocate, etc.

The job of a workshop instructor is to encourage class participation, collaboration, and learning at every step of the process.

## Technical Trainings

Trainings are typically more formal than workshops and have a number of objectives that must be covered. Labs are often a time for students work alone on a task, or perhaps with one other peer, but rarely does the entire class work together to solve problems.

Training can often mimic a lecture style with labs between topics. There’s an emphasis on exposing students to technical material and teaching a specific method of solving a problem. There is rarely enough time to allow for creative exploration as trainings typically pack so much technical content in, there’s little room for slips in schedule.

## Technical Courses

While workshops can last for hours, and trainings for days, courses can last for weeks. These are essentially a formal collection of technical trainings that work towards meeting minimum curriculum goals with student evaluations in the form of quizzes, tests, and exams.

There’s often a rigid structure that blends lectures, trainings, labs, and homework. Students are generally on their own to learn the material after being exposed to it in class, demonstrating what they’ve learned in formal evaluations before receiving a weighted grade, comparing them to their peers.

# Conclusion

Hopefully, it’s obvious there are many ways to deliver technical material. Each method has its own pros and cons. While we strive to provide material that can be used to facilitate a workshop, we hope this content can be incorporated into trainings and courses with minimal effort.
