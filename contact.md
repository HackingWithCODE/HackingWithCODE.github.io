## Local Workshops

CO/DE's workshops will be taught live in Columbus, OH to help test the material, generate feedback, and improve the material for everyone. As content is developed and ready for testing, we'll invite people to experience our workshops, free of charge. [Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hackingwithcode) for updates and announcements about workshops.
