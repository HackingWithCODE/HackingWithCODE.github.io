## Teach a Workshop

Workshops are 2-3 hour hands-on sessions where students get a chance to immediately apply what they learn. Teaching a workshop is incredibly rewarding and gives you a chance to share your experience, talent, and meet new people. If you would like to teach a workshop, please contact us.

Here are some things to consider if you're planning a workshop:

- Teams work best! Having 1 instructor with 2 mentors to help students insures a smooth workshop.
- Teach, show, challenge, repeat.
- A hour lecture followed by a single problem will disengage students.
- Keep students on their toes, ask questions, work through a challenge as a group.
- Break up leacture time into 15-20 minute chunks with challenges in between.
- Provide pre-workshop setup instructions (if possible) so students can hit the ground running.
- Consider the cost of tools used in your workshop and aim to utilize free resources if possible.


## Assistance

If you need assistance reviewing material for your workshop please reach out to us. If you're looking for mentors to help during a workshop we can help you find the right people.


## Ownership of Materials

As an instructor and creator of a workshop you retain all ownership of your teaching material. CO/DE is working to open-source workshops so they can be developed and improved by the community and used by all.
